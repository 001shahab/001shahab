# üåü About Me: Pioneering AI Innovation
üî• I‚Äôm a trailblazing researcher and innovator, currently spearheading cutting-edge projects like A2A and MCP AI Agents, LLM-powered smart document management systems, deep learning-driven facial expression analysis, Responsible AI frameworks, and MLLM-based context analysis. My technical mastery spans computer vision, human-robot interaction, applied NLP, 3D modeling, augmented and virtual reality, and advanced programming in Python, Keras, and TensorFlow. I‚Äôm at the forefront of AI, seamlessly leveraging OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google LLM APIs to craft transformative, real-world solutions that redefine industries.

üöÄ My entrepreneurial vision shines through my groundbreaking ventures. In 2013, I founded the Intelligent Computer Vision (iCV) research lab, establishing the Baltic States‚Äô premier hub for computer vision and applied machine learning. I also launched 3S Holding O√ú, an AI boutique powerhouse delivering hundreds of state-of-the-art Agentic AI, Generative AI, and NLP solutions for global leaders in eCommerce, Retail, SecTech, and FinTech. My hands-on approach has produced countless proof-of-concepts (POCs) and MVPs in record time, turning bold ideas into market-ready innovations.

ü§ù As a co-founder of Estonia‚Äôs first Responsible AI HRTech startup, iVCV, I‚Äôve showcased my entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to ethical AI. As an early-stage angel investor, I fuel revolutionary tech concepts, empowering the next wave of innovation. My leadership has driven high-impact R&D projects for industry giants, delivering bespoke AI solutions that solve complex challenges and set new benchmarks in performance and scalability.

üìù My research legacy is unparalleled, with over 300 publications‚Äîincluding conference papers, journal articles, books, and patents‚Äîthat have shaped the global AI landscape. As a distinguished IEEE Senior Member and former Chair of the IEEE Estonian section‚Äôs Joint Societies Chapter, I‚Äôve left an indelible mark on the academic community. I serve as an associate editor for prestigious journals and have led special issues on human behavior analysis.

üéì A mentor to the next generation, I‚Äôve guided ten doctoral and over thirty MSc students, nurturing future AI pioneers. My global influence extends to organizing high-profile workshops at FG17, CVPR17, ICCV17, ECML19, FG20, and FG24, alongside conferences like ICOSST, ICGIP, and SIU. My work has earned prestigious grants from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey, the Estonian Research Council, and the European Union, underscoring my ability to secure funding for visionary projects.

üí° My career is a testament to my leadership in computer vision, machine learning, and AI innovation. From building game-changing tools to mentoring talent and driving industry-defining solutions, I‚Äôm passionate about pushing the boundaries of intelligent technology. My hands-on, results-driven approach has made me a sought-after collaborator for transformative AI projects.
